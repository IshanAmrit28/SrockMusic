# 🎵 S.Rocks.Music – Home Screen Module (Flutter + Firebase)

This Flutter project replicates the **Home Screen** from the S.Rocks.Music app, based on the provided Figma design. It demonstrates responsive UI, dynamic Firebase Firestore integration, and clean navigation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 **Responsive UI** matching Figma design
- ☁️ **Cloud Firestore Integration** (read-only)
- 🧭 **Navigation** to specific screens on tap
- 📦 **Provider** for basic state management

## 🔌 Firebase Firestore Integration

- This app connects to **Cloud Firestore** and fetches all service data from the `services` collection.
- Each document in `services` represents a single **service card** rendered on the Home Screen.

### 🔍 Firestore Document Fields

| Field        | Type   | Description                                     |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `background` | String | Path or name for the background image asset     |
| `leftIcon`   | String | Icon asset shown on the left of the card        |
| `title`      | String | Title of the service (e.g., "Music Production") |
| `subtitle`   | String | Short description/subtitle of the service       |
| `rightIcon`  | String | Icon asset on the right (e.g., arrow or symbol) |
| `pageId`     | String | ID used to navigate to the correct page         |

✅ Demonstrates:

- Dynamic Firestore data fetching
- Asynchronous UI rendering
- Reusable, data-driven component design

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Initial UI Creation**

   - Set up the base Flutter project with themes, fonts, and structure.
   - Built the `mainscreen.dart` with a **Bottom Navigation Bar** to manage multiple views.

2. **Building the Home Screen**

   - UI was structured using a mix of **`Column`** and **`Row`** widgets for clean alignment.
   - The layout mirrors the Figma design closely, and uses reusable widgets like `Header` and `Background`.

3. **Dynamic Data Loading**

   - Fetched all service card data from Firestore instead of hardcoding.
   - Cards render based on the Firestore data — including icon, title, subtitle, and background.

4. **Navigation**

   - Each card uses a `GestureDetector` to navigate to a new page based on the `pageId`.
   - This dynamically opens the correct screen (e.g., `MusicProduction`, `Mixing`, etc.).

5. **Responsive Design**
   - The UI is fully responsive across devices using `MediaQuery`, flexible spacing, and alignment.
   - All components adapt to screen size while maintaining clean aesthetics.
